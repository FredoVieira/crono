# crono
Used for countdown, cronometer, or just to show the time. You can change the font, the size and the color.
You don't need to buy expensive panels to show time (or a countdown) for all the people in a event.
Only with your computer and screen (or a big TV) you can show the information for all of them.

If some font (TTF) doens't work, it means that your system hasn't that installed (localhost).
If a font is missing (localhost), just copy the TTF file to your Font Path,
  used to be in:
    C:\WINDOWS\Fonts
Or right click with your mouse on the desired font and chose the Install option.

I hope you enjoy;
Hugs.
